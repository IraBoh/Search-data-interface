# Solution Summary - Indian Export Search

This solution enables efficient search and retrieval of large-scale Indian export data (~100,000 rows per month) through a scalable web interface, balancing immediate usability with future growth considerations.

## Current Implementation

### Technology Stack
FastAPI was selected for the backend because it provides automatic API documentation and type checking. Mithril.js was chosen for its minimalistic design and fast performance, making it ideal for handling large datasets in the browser. 

### Data Management & Processing
The solution evolved through two approaches to handle data effectively:

1. Initial Excel Processing:
   - Direct file reading using pandas
   - Enables rapid prototyping and testing
   - Limited by memory constraints
   - Validates core functionality

2. SQLite Implementation:
   - Structured storage for better query performance
   - Handles larger datasets more efficiently
   - Enables proper data indexing
   - Serves as stepping stone to future database migration

This dual approach allows immediate functionality while preparing for future data growth. SQLite was chosen over direct Excel processing because it provides better query performance and more sustainable data management.

### Search Implementation Strategy
The search implements multi-field, case-insensitive partial matching across Products and Companies as users typically remember fragments of information rather than exact terms. This adaptive approach handles real-world variations in spelling and capitalization, making the search practical for daily use. Pagination was added from the start since the dataset grows by 100,000 rows monthly, ensuring both system performance and user-friendly result navigation. Column selection functionality was implemented to help users focus on relevant data in large result sets.

## Future Improvements

### 1. Database Migration
As data volume increases, migration to a more scalable database system will enable:
- Concurrent user access
- Better network capabilities
- Efficient data archiving

### 2. Automation
To ensure efficiency and reduce manual effort, the system requires automated workflows for:
- File import from designated storage (e.g., NAS)
- Excel file detection and processing
- Archive management
- Scheduled maintenance tasks

### 3. Performance
Key optimizations planned:
- Year/month data partitioning
- Query caching
- Full-text search capabilities

### 4. User Interface Enhancements
To improve user efficiency and interaction with large datasets, the following enhancements are planned:
- Customizable table views:
  - Drag-and-drop column reordering
  - Custom column width adjustment
- Advanced filtering options:
  - Multi-column filters
  - Date range filters
  - Save filter presets
- Data utilization features:
  - Export formats to be determined by user needs
  - Flexible data presentation options
  - Additional functionality based on user feedback

Note: Final implementation of data presentation and export features will be refined through end-user consultation to ensure alignment with actual usage patterns and requirements.
This approach ensures a balance between rapid deployment and long-term maintainability, allowing the system to evolve seamlessly as data volume and user needs expand.
